The Latest News Platform provides an .Net Server that serves latest news RESTfully, and an AngularJS Client to display and manipulate Latest News Articles with sources and images.
# Setup and Build
## Server
- CD to LatestNewsTestBackend
- To build the server on Dotnet 8 core runtime you should make sure these required dependencies are listed in the *.cproj* file inside :
``` xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="8.0.7" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="8.0.7" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools" Version="8.0.7">
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="CacheCow.Server.Core.Mvc" Version="2.13.1" />
```
If you are using VS Code, install these one by one in the terminal using this command ```nuget install <packageID | configFilePath> [options]```, consult officail docs : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-install

If you are Using VS Studio, make sure you have the latest .net8 release and usually your IDE would auto install the listed packages on first build.

### Database
- Make sure you have MS SQLserver installed on your server machine or an SQLlocalDB on your Visual Studio for quick development setup.
- Make sure to add an *appsettings.json* file into the server root with the following sections:
``` json
    {
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information",
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultSQLServer": "<YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
  },
  "ApiKey": "<YOUR NEWS API KEY HERE>",
  "PlaceholderImage": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586339949916-3e9457bef6d3?q=80&w=1770&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"
}

```
Replace the values between tags '<>' with your own, you can set a custom Placeholder Image for the server to put into articles that come without image url.

### Database partitioning
Our choice of EF Core leaves us without any practical ways to partition the DB (this was realized later into the project), so this feature was dropped until a solution is found.

### Background worker - news fetcher
Upon starting the server, a background worker thread will start on it own, calling the News API in a loop and updating the server database with the latest found news articles with their sources.

This worker may query the API with the arguments : Date (if there are records on the DB to rely on), apikey (required).
and has a fixed delay before it invokes a new query.

To modify the delay interval this worker invokes in. go to *NewsFetchService.cs* and alter the number shown bellow :
``` c#
        _logger.LogInformation($"News Fetcher Service Updated {newsresponse.totalResults} new articles");
    }
    /// This is a delay to not overload the NEWS API Servers, 
    /// this background worker will request new records every X hours, observe "FromHours(1)"
    await Task.Delay(((int)TimeSpan.FromHours(1).TotalMilliseconds), cancellationToken);
}

```

### Authentication üîê
This is an internal server, there is no public access authentication.

### Endpoints ‚ùáÔ∏è
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cde9132-6a75-4a8c-b42c-28e0f340db5b)

- An error HTTP 415 Unsupported media response means that the resquest body is not in json format or doesnt comply with data schema.
  
- An error HTTP 404 Not found response means that the specified route is not valid.

- An error HTTP 401 Unauthorized response means that you are not authorised to make such calls and need CORS allowance.
  
- An HTTP 5xx response will almost never occure due to the internal database being auto-reconnected automatically.

### Server-side caching
This server implements HTTP response caching over 5 minutes, meaning it saves endpoint responses into memory and re-uses them when appropriate, achieved with the open source CachCow library. 

## Client
- To build the server on AngularJS 17 you should first install NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer
- Next Install Angualr by running this command ```npm install -g @angular/cli@17``` on your terminal.
- Once Angular is installed, CD to LatestNewsTestFrontend and install Bootstrap and Material Libraries by excuting these commands on the Angular CLI, ```ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap``` and ```ng add @angular/material```  (recommended to use VScode terminal)
- On the same terminal. Build and Run the client with ```ng serve``` or ```ng serve -o``` to open in the browser.
### Access to server
In the *app.component.ts* file, update the port number with the server port.
``` js
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.httpclient.get<Article[]>('https://localhost:<YOUR PORT NUMBER HERE>/News/getall')
      .subscribe(result => {
        this.articleService.allArticles = result.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.publishedAt).getTime() - new Date(a.publishedAt).getTime());;
        console.log(this.articleService.allArticles);
      })
  }
```
On the server side, update the CORS policy in *program.cs* to include the client adress.
``` c#
  builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
  {
      options.AddPolicy("CORSPolicy",
          builder =>
          {
              builder
              .AllowAnyMethod()
              .AllowAnyHeader()
              .WithOrigins("http://localhost:<YOUR CLIENT PORT NUMBER HERE>");
          });
  });
```
### Client-side caching
This client implements session storage caching, this is a combined server/client mechanisme, meaning the client first makes a new request for all articles, the server respondes as expected and attach a proprety saying what is the last Article ID in the response array (article IDs are created and incremented in the server so they are pre-sorted by ID), this allows the client to store the response object in Session-Storage and make future requests using that stored LastID to only request the newest articles, reducing load on DB and improving Client responsiveness.

### Run everything
Make sure to run both the server and client with - ```ng serve -o``` and ```DotNet Run``` respectively.
